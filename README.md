# Hello there! 👋

I'm Srishti, your seasoned data guide with a Master's from Purdue University. 🎓 I specialize in data analysis, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), data cleaning, sentiment analysis, and data visualization. 📊 Fluent in SQL and Python, I'm passionate about uncovering insights and telling compelling stories through data. 📈

Beyond certifications, I've practical and research experience with the Ph.D. group at Virginia Tech, where I co-authored impactful papers on predicting mental health, opioid crisis detection, and hotel industry trends – recognized at the ASONAM 2023 Industrial Track Paper Conference in Turkey. 📚

Armed with a strong foundation in data engineering, I'm intrigued by the engineering side of data, particularly related to LLMs and AI. 🤖 Considering the privacy concerns introduced by LLMs, I'm eager to gain exposure to data security. 🔒

Currently, I'm focused on building robust systems for data processing, from ingestion to visualization. 💻 My goal is to seamlessly transition into Product Management, leveraging my technical expertise to drive innovation. 🚀

I'm seeking roles in Product Data Analytics, Technology Analyst, Technical Program Management, Business Intelligence Engineering, and Data Engineering. Let's connect, explore, and create innovative solutions together. 🤝

Feel free to reach me at [behalsrishti08@gmail.com](mailto:behalsrishti08@gmail.com) with any project ideas or opportunities. 📧

Cheers, 🥂  
Srishti
