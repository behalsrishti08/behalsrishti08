# Hello there! 👋

I'm Srishti, your seasoned data guide with a Master's from Purdue University. 🎓 I'm adept at everything from sourcing and cleaning datasets to skillful manipulation and presenting insightful visualizations. 📊 I'm your go-to person for unraveling the stories hidden within the data. 💡 Fluent in SQL and Python, I'm on a fearless quest to conquer new tech realms and tools. 🐍

Beyond certifications, I've practical and research experience with the Ph.D. group at Virginia Tech, where I co-authored three impactful papers on predicting mental health, opioid crisis detection, and a standout hotel industry project – recognized at the ASONAM 2023 Industrial Track Paper Conference in Turkey. 📚

Think of me as your problem-solving superhero. 💪 Armed with a strong foundation in data engineering, I'm intrigued by the engineering side of data, particularly related to LLMs and AI. 🤖 Considering the privacy concerns introduced by LLMs, I'm eager to gain exposure to data security. 🔒

Currently immersed in learning how to build intense systems – overseeing the entire process from data ingestion to result generation, implementing egress to declare system completion, and efficiently transferring data across various systems. Additionally, I'm constantly thinking of ways to build systems with a mindset of cost optimization, actively developing solutions to reduce expenses. 💻

My goal? Attain sufficient technical proficiency to seamlessly transition into Product Management! 🚀 Fast forward a decade, and I see myself at the forefront of a groundbreaking product – envisioning a futuristic creation that transforms how we engage with technology. 🔮

I'm currently on the lookout for roles that align with my goals, such as Product Data Analytics, Technology Analyst, Technical Program Management, Business Intelligence Engineering, and Data Engineering. Let's connect, explore, and create innovative solutions together. 🤝

If you have any interesting project ideas, suggestions, or anything that can help me get closer to my goals, I would love to connect with you. You can reach me at [behalsrishti08@gmail.com](mailto:behalsrishti08@gmail.com). 📧
